        <h1>What is it?</h1>
        The problem with today’s music player applications is that their shuffle algorithms are random which means that people are not getting the best listening experience they could from their music. 
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h1>What does it do?</h1>
        This project aims to improve that by quantifying the user’s preference on a basic level: if they listen to it a lot, they must like it a lot.

          The application can be installed on any smartphone running <strong>Android 5+</strong>. The logic was written in <em>Java</em>, using the Android API and the User Interface is built from <em>XML</em> files, which are parsed and compiled to Java objects. Currently, there are a total of <strong>2423</strong> lines of code, 1940 of which are Java code, 483 lines are XML code (layout and the Manifest file).

        <h1>How does the algorithm work?</h1>
        <p>
          Aside from the arcane incantations and the <a href="http://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/blog/2016/02/25/javascript-mancy-vlog-what-is-ecmascript-6/">Java-mancy</a>?
        </p>

        <p>
          It's pretty simple: 
          <ul>
            <li>
              The algorithm assigns a <em>"weight"</em> to each song in your library (in part <em>random</em>, in other part based on <em>how many times you listened to each song</em>).
            </li>
            <li>
              It puts all the weights in a composite data structure, mapping the <em>songs</em> to their <em>weights</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
              When you request a new song, a <em>random number</em> is generated and used to pick a song; kind of like throwing a dart: the <em>bigger</em> the song's weight, the <em>higher chances</em> it has to be picked.
            </li>
          </ul> 
        </p>
